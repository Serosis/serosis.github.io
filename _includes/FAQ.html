								<div class="panel-body">
									<p class="indent justify">Well first you make a backup copy of your original .exe, which should be by default in your
										<code>C:\Program Files\The Ur-Quan Masters\</code> directory.
										The file mentioned is named <code>uqm.exe</code>, you can change the
										name to something else like <code>uqm-backup.exe</code> or
										<code>uqm-original.exe</code>. Don't worry if you can't see the
										<code>.exe</code> bit in the filename. By default that view is turned off.</p>
									<p class="indent justify">After you have completed the above you can UnZIP the mod you downloaded straight into the directory aformentionted,
										which again by default is <code>C:\Program Files\The Ur-Quan Masters\</code><br />
										When that is all done you can run the game.</p>

							</div>
							<div id="diff" class="panel-collapse collapse" style="height: 0px;">
								<div class="panel-body">
									<p class="indent justify">The .diff files are here only because I thought it would more efficient than to upload
										the entire source code for such relatively minor changes. These files should only be
										of use if you are planning to compile your own version of these mods or if you are
										cross compiling. To use these patch files on Windows you need to set up MinGW and MSYS,
										which is explained in the INSTALL.mingw file that comes with UQM's source code.</p>
									<p class="indent justify">Copy the releveant .diff file you want into the
										<code>/uqm-0.7.0/sc2</code> directory, open up a Terminal(MSYS for Windows users),
										<code>cd</code> into the directory where you placed the .diff and execute
										the command, <code>patch -p0 -i *.diff</code>. * Being the name of the .diff. <br />
										If all goes without a hitch you can begin compiling the source code.</p>

							<div id="3dovideo" class="panel-collapse collapse" style="height: 0px;">
								<div class="panel-body">
									<h4>Windows</h4>
									<p class="indent justify">To make things easier on the community I have made available all the videos to
										download in one handy .zip file. You can get this file on the <a href="./Downloads">Downloads</a> page.</p>
									<p class="justify">To use them just extract the folder from within the zip file to your
										<code>addons</code> directory. Which by default is <br /><br />
										<code>C:\Program Files\The Ur-Quan Masters\content\addons\</code><br />
										or <br />
										<code>C:\Program Files (x86)\The Ur-Quan Masters\content\addons\</code> in 64bit Windows<br /><br />
										After that you can just load up UQM and opt to use the 3DO videos instead of the PC slides.</p>
									<hr />
									<h4>MacOS X</h4>
									<p class="justify">
										Right click on the UQM app and select <code>Show Package Contents</code><br/>
										Navigate to <code>Contents -> Resources -> content -> addons</code><br/>
										Extract the <code>uqm-0.7.0-3dovideos.zip</code> file into the <code>addons</code> folder.

								<h4 class="panel-title">How do I use the MegaMod cheats?</h4>
							</div>
							<div id="megamod" class="panel-collapse collapse" style="height: 0px;">
								<div class="panel-body">
									<h4>Windows</h4>
									<p class="indent justify">
										For Windows you can use the cheats through commandline, batch file, in the uqm.cfg file, or in a shortcut. 
										Say you wanted to use a desktop shortcut, you would right-click the shortcut and go into its properties
										and add any cheat at the end of the "Target:". It should look like <a class="js-mediaSwipe" href="./img/landmarks/CheatMode.png" >this.</a>
									</p>
									<p class="indent justify">
										I would advise against using the uqm.cfg method simply because the cheats are off by default and if you were to change
										any settings while in UQM it would reset the uqm.cfg file. In other words, get the settings how you want them first before
										applying cheats.
									</p>
									<hr />
									<h4>MacOS X</h4>
									<p class="indent justify">
										For OS X things get a bit more complicated. You can run commandline arguments using the <i>open</i> command, add them to the <i>.cfg</i>, 
										or use the Automator script I included with the app.
									</p>
									<h5>Commandline</h5>
									<p class="indent justify">
										In this example I will assume you installed the MegaMod .app into the Applications folder: <br />
										For those that are already familiar with using the Terminal commandline, arguments using the <i>open</i> command should be a walk in the cake.
										Simply open up your Terminal and type in: <code>open -a "The Ur-Quan Masters MegaMod.app" --args</code> or <code>open -a "The Ur-Quan Masters HD MegaMod.app" --args</code>
										Depending on the version you installed. Then you type in whichever commandline argument you wish after. So if you wanted the headstart cheat you'd type in: 
										<code>--headstart</code> After <code>--args</code><br />
										You can put in as many commandline arguments you want after: <code>--args</code>
									</p>
									<h5>Editing the uqm.cfg</h5>
									<p class="indent justify">
										Word of warning. Changes to the .cfg file are reset every time you enter the setup menu in-game. So make whatever changes you need in-game before
										editing the .cfg
									</p>
									<p class="indent justify">
										To edit the .cfg file you have to run UQM or UQM-HD at least once and go to their respective setup menus. This creates (and resets) the uqm.cfg file.<br />
										Open Finder, on the Menu Bar select: <code>Go -> Go To Folder...</code> And type in either: <code>~/.uqm/</code> or <code>~/.uqmhd/</code> Depending on the 
										version you installed This brings you to the user folder that contains the uqm.cfg file.
									</p>
									<p class="indent justify">
										Open the uqm.cfg file with any text editor you have. Inside there should be a nice unordered list of options which include all of the cheat options.
										Again I'll use headstart as an example. Find: <code>headStart = BOOLEAN:false</code> Change, "false" to, "true" and save the the changes.
									</p>
									<h5>Using the CMD Line Automator</h5>
									<p class="justify">
										This process assumes you installed UQM or UQM-HD in the Applications folder.
									</p>
									<p class="indent justify">
										Copy <i>CMD Line Automator</i> wherever you'd like. Open Automator, you can search for it in Spotlight or open it up directly from your Applications folder.
										You will be greeted with a, "new file" window, at the bottom select <code>Open an Existing Document...</code> and select the <i>CMD Line Automator</i> file.
										It should look something <a class="js-mediaSwipe" href="./img/landmarks/Automator.png">like this.</a>
									</p>
									<p class="indent justify">
										From here on the process is the same as using the commandline options except that after you're done adding in the options you save the file and run it.
										You can put the CMD Line Automator anywhere you want, all it does is open up the app using the commandline options.
