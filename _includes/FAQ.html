									<p class="indent justify">Well first you make a backup copy of your original .exe, which should be by default in your
										<code>C:\Program Files\The Ur-Quan Masters\</code> directory.
										The file mentioned is named <code>uqm.exe</code>, you can change the
										name to something else like <code>uqm-backup.exe</code> or
										<code>uqm-original.exe</code>. Don't worry if you can't see the
										<code>.exe</code> bit in the filename. By default that view is turned off.</p>
									<p class="indent justify">After you have completed the above you can UnZIP the mod you downloaded straight into the directory aformentionted,
										which again by default is <code>C:\Program Files\The Ur-Quan Masters\</code><br />
										When that is all done you can run the game.</p>

									<p class="indent justify">The .diff files are here only because I thought it would more efficient than to upload
										the entire source code for such relatively minor changes. These files should only be
										of use if you are planning to compile your own version of these mods or if you are
										cross compiling. To use these patch files on Windows you need to set up MinGW and MSYS,
										which is explained in the INSTALL.mingw file that comes with UQM's source code.</p>
									<p class="indent justify">Copy the releveant .diff file you want into the
										<code>/uqm-0.7.0/sc2</code> directory, open up a Terminal(MSYS for Windows users),
										<code>cd</code> into the directory where you placed the .diff and execute
										the command, <code>patch -p0 -i *.diff</code>. * Being the name of the .diff. <br />
										If all goes without a hitch you can begin compiling the source code.</p>

									<h4>Windows</h4>
									<p class="indent justify">To make things easier on the community I have made available all the videos to
										download in one handy .zip file. You can get this file on the <a href="./Downloads">Downloads</a> page.</p>
									<p class="justify">To use them just extract the folder from within the zip file to your
										<code>addons</code> directory. Which by default is <br /><br />
										<code>C:\Program Files\The Ur-Quan Masters\content\addons\</code><br />
										or <br />
										<code>C:\Program Files (x86)\The Ur-Quan Masters\content\addons\</code> in 64bit Windows<br /><br />
										After that you can just load up UQM and opt to use the 3DO videos instead of the PC slides.</p>

									<h4>MacOS X</h4>
									<p class="justify">
										Right click on the UQM app and select <code>Show Package Contents</code><br/>
										Navigate to <code>Contents -> Resources -> content -> addons</code><br/>
										Extract the <code>uqm-0.7.0-3dovideos.zip</code> file into the <code>addons</code> folder.
